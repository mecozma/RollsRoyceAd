        <h1>"At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock"</h1>
        <h2>What <u>makes</u> Rolls Royce the best car in the world? <em>"There is really no magic about it-- 
        <br />it is merely patient attention to detail,"</em> says an eminent Rolls-Royce engineer.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>"At 60 miles per hour the loudest noise comes from the electric clock,"</em>reports the Technical Editor of THE MOTOR. Three muflers tune out sound frequencies-- acoustically.</li>
            <li><em>"Every Rolls-Royce engine is run for seven hours at full throttle before instalation, and each car is test-driven for hundreds of miles over varying road surfaces"</em></li>
            <li>The<em>Rolls-Royce</em> is designed as an <em>owner-driven</em>car. IT is eighteen inches shorter than the largest domestic cars.</li>
            <li>The car has power steering, power brakes and automatic gear-shift. It is very easy to driveand to park. No chauffeur required.</li>
            <li>The finished car spends a week in the final test-shop, being fine-tuned. Here it is subjected to 98 separate ordeals. For example, the engineers use a <em>"stethoscope"</em> to listen for axle-whine.</li>
            <li>The Rolls-Royce is guaranteed for <em>"three years."</em> With a new network of dealers and parts-depots from Coast to Coast, service is no problem.</li>
            <li>The Rolls-Royce radiator has never been changed, except that when Sir Henry Royce died in 1933 the monogram RR was changed from red to black.</li>
            <li>The coachwork is given five coats of primer paint, and hand rubbed between each coat, before <em>nine</em> coats of finishing paint go on.</li>
            <li>By moving a switch on the steering column, you can adjust the shock-absorbers to suit road conditions.</li>
            <li>A picnic table, veneered in French walnut, slides out from under the dash. Two more swing out behind the fromt seats.</li>
            <li>You can get such optional extras as an Expresso coffee-making machine, a dictating machine, a bed, hot and cold water for washing, an electric razor or a phone.</li>
            <li>There are three separate systems of power brake, two hydraulic and one mechanical. Damage to one system will not affect the others. The Rolls-Royce is a very <em>safe</em>car--and also a very <em>lively</em>car.It cruizes serenely at eighty-five. Top speed is in excess of 100 m.p.h.</li>
            <li>The Bentley is made by Rolls-Royce. Except the radiators, they are identical motor cars, manufactured by the same engineers in the same works. People who feel diffident about driving a Rolls-Royce can buy a Bentley. <strong>Price</strong>The Rolls-Royce illustrated in this advertisment-- f.o.b. principal ports of entry-- costs <strong>$13,995.</strong></li>
